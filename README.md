# Neural-Network-in-Cpp
Making a Neural Network class using only "vector" library in c++ language, while implementing Matrix math and Gradient Descent algorithm.
An example of the learning will be uploaded soon.

Notes:
- Currently support 1 hidden layer (and 1 input and 1 output), but as many neurons as the user wants in each.
- The data should be feeded as a Matrix obejct (which implemeneted on the code), and can be constructed 
with a vector(vector(double)) object (Same as list of lists in Python language).
- A CSV parser to a correct dataset, for my NN input will be uploaded soon.
